abstract:     Traveling Salesman Problem hasn't lost it's popularity for some 70 years, and is, nowdays used in fields such as planning, logistics, microchip manufacturing, DNA sequencing, etc.
TSP is an NP-complete problem, and, as such, is best solved using heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization, etc.
In this work we discuss possible methods for optimizing mutation operators used by GA to solve TSP.
Test results show that, especially in case of large number of cities, they are effective solution-wise, but are costly time-wise.
